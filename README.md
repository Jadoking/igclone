# igclone
small project, webbased IG clone

A simple webbased IG clone

Clone Repo and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install requirements
run using ./manage.py runserver or python manage.py runserver on windows

by default this runs at localhost:8000

To create users use the ./manage.py createsuperuser or python manage.py createsuperuser

With more time I would have liked to flesh somethings out but for now things are pretty basic

Users can post search for and follow/unfollow other users
When you follow a user they will appear in ur feed which is in this case the root url
